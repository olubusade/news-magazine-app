# React + Vite

The news magazine app was developed using React and Vite. And it is powered by https://newsapi.org, the API that provides users with the latest news articles from around the world. The app offers a user-friendly interface where news articles are organized by categories, allowing users to easily browse and read articles of their interest.

Features
1. Category-based News: The app categorizes news articles into various categories, including entertainment, business, sports, technology, health, science, and more. Users can click on a category to view articles specific to that category.

2. Article Details: Each article is displayed with a title, description, publication date, channel, and a link to visit the source website. This ensures that users can get a comprehensive understanding of the news article before deciding to read more.

Responsive Design: The app is designed to be responsive, providing a seamless experience across different screen sizes and devices. Whether users access the app from their desktop, tablet, or smartphone, the interface will adapt smoothly to fit their device.

Technologies Used
1. React: The app is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React provides a robust foundation for creating interactive and dynamic components.

2. Styled-Components: Styled-Components is used for styling the app. It allows developers to write CSS within JavaScript, making it easier to manage styles for individual components.

3. React-Bootstrap: React-Bootstrap is utilized for building responsive and customizable UI components. It provides a wide range of pre-built components that can be easily integrated into the app.
